    <h2 style="text-align:center" id="what-is">What is Formula 1?</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.formula1.com/">Formula One</a> (also known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of
        international auto racing for single-seater
        formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l&apos;Automobile (<b>FIA &copy;</b>). The
        World
        Drivers&apos;
        Championship, which became the <b>FIA &copy;</b> Formula One World Championship in 1981, has been one of the
        premier
        forms of
        racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. The word formula in the name refers to the set of
        rules to which all participants&apos; cars must conform. A Formula One season consists of a series of races,
        known
        as Grands Prix, which take place worldwide on both purpose-built circuits and closed public roads.</p>
    <p>The results of each race are evaluated using a points system to determine two annual World Championships: one for
        drivers, the other for constructors. Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class of racing
        licence issued by the <b>FIA &copy;</b>. The races must run on tracks graded &quot;1&quot; (formerly
        &quot;A&quot;),
        the highest grade-rating
        issued by the <b>FIA &copy;</b>. Most events occur in rural locations on purpose-built tracks, but several
        events take
        place on city streets.</p>
    <p>Formula One cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the world, owing to very high cornering
        speeds achieved through the generation of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce. The cars underwent major
        changes in 2017, allowing wider front and rear wings, and wider tyres, resulting in peak cornering forces
        near 6.5 lateral g and top speeds of around 350 km/h (215 mph). As of 2021, the hybrid engines are limited
        in performance to a maximum of 15,000 rpm; the cars are very dependent on electronics and aerodynamics,
        suspension and tyres. Traction control, launch control, and automatic shifting, plus other electronic driving
        aids, were first banned in 1994, reintroduced in 2001, and have more recently been banned since 2004 and 2008,
        respectively.</p>
    <p>While Europe is the sport&apos;s traditional base, the championship operates globally, with 13 of the 23 races in
        the
        2021 season taking place outside Europe. With the annual cost of running a mid-tier team – designing, building,
        and maintaining cars, pay, transport – being US$120 million, its financial and political
        battles are widely reported. Its high profile and popularity have created a major merchandising environment,
        which has resulted in large investments from sponsors and budgets (in the hundreds of millions for the
        constructors). On 23 January 2017, Liberty Media confirmed the completion of the acquisition of Delta Topco, the
        company that controls Formula One, from private-equity firm CVC Capital Partners for $8 billion.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center" id="history">A bit of F1 history</h2>
    <p>The Formula One series originated with the European Championship of Grand Prix motor racing (q.v. for pre-1947
        history) of the 1920s and 1930s. The formula consists of a set of rules that all participants&apos; cars must
        meet.
        Formula One was a new formula agreed upon during 1946 after World War II, with the first non-championship races
        taking place that year. The first Formula 1 race was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix. A number of Grand Prix racing
        organisations had laid out rules for a world championship before the war, but due to the suspension of racing
        during the conflict, the World Drivers&apos; Championship did not become formalised until 1947. The first world
        championship race took place at Silverstone in the United Kingdom in 1950. A championship for constructors
        followed in 1958. National championships existed in South Africa and the UK in the 1960s and 1970s.
        Non-championship Formula One events were held by promoters for many years, but due to the increasing cost of
        competition, the last of these occurred in 1983.</p>
